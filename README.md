# Car-Price-and-Horsepower-Clustering-with-K-Means
# Introduction
This project involves clustering car data based on their price and horsepower using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The aim is to identify distinct groups (clusters) of cars that share similar characteristics in terms of price and horsepower.

# Project Overview
The project includes the following steps:

Data Collection: Gathering car data, including features like price and horsepower.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for clustering.
K-Means Clustering: Applying the K-Means algorithm to group the cars into clusters.
Analysis and Visualization: Analyzing and visualizing the resulting clusters to understand the underlying patterns in the data.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various cars, specifically focusing on their price and horsepower. This data is essential for training the K-Means model and deriving meaningful clusters.

# Key Sections in the Notebook
Data Exploration:
Load the dataset and display basic statistics.
Visualize the distribution of price and horsepower.
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and outliers.
Normalize the data for better clustering performance.
K-Means Clustering:
Apply the K-Means algorithm with an optimal number of clusters.
Analyze the characteristics of each cluster.
Visualization:
Plot the clusters to visualize the separation based on price and horsepower.
Use various plots to interpret the results.
Prediction:
Predict the cluster for new car data based on user input (horsepower and price).
